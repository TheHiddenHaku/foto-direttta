# What is Foto-Diretta?

Foto-Diretta wants to be an archive to memorize the programming of live events (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube or other channels).
The focus of the project is on events relating to photography, but it can be used for any type of topic.

The application is developed with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [LiveWire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

A lot of attention is paid to privacy, for this reason the event proposals are anonymous, in moderation by the site administrators. It does not store any user data, no statistical tracking is performed.

Foto-Diretta in English means:
```
Foto -> Photo
Diretta -> Live events
```

## Why?

During COVID-19 lockdown spontaneous live photographic events flourished worldwide through different channels (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.). Too many not to miss out some we might really wanted to attend at.

What if you could check in advance the scheduled ones by your contacts or loved authors?

Anyone can stay tuned, search event by title, authors or date.

## How work
Foto-Diretta will be always updated: like Wikipedia, anyone can contribute and can propose a live event. No registration is necessary, the eventi will be showed after moderation by site admin.
